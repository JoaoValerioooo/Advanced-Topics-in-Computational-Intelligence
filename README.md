# Advanced-Topics-in-Computational-Intelligence

The objective of this course is to introduce and deepen the framework of learning by reinforcement, where an agent learns the appropriate behavior to solve its objectives from direct interactions of the agent with the environment and without previous knowledge of the world.

Specifically, the course will begin introducing the most basic concepts of learning by reinforcement until reaching the most modern algorithms that are state of the art. Next the course will deepen in different advanced techniques that try to extend the described frame to (1) a more efficient learning from techniques of exploration and of modelization of the environment, (2) to a continuous learning of the agent to different tasks necessary for a General Artificial Intelligence and (3) to the automatic learning of behaviors in systems multi-agents either in cooperative and competitive environments.

When finishing, the student will know the state of the art in reinforcement learning and the domains where it is appropriate to apply it, and she will have implemented different algorithms in the programming frameworks more relevant in the area.
